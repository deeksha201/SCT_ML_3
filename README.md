Project Title:
🐶🐱 Cat and Dog Image Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)



Project Description:
This project focuses on building an image classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and consists of labeled images of both categories. The project involves image preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. The objective is to demonstrate how SVM can be applied to solve real-world image classification problems.
